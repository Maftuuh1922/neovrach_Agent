# Neovarch Kantor — "Perusahaan" worker flow (design)

Branch `feature-office-company` (from `fix-core-parity`). Concepts adapted from
Paperclip (MIT, github.com/paperclipai/paperclip: doc/SPEC-implementation.md §7–§11) —
no code copied; rewritten for Neovarch's Python core, Electron/React desktop and Flutter remote.

## 1. Principles
- **Off by default, never surprising.** The company exists only after the user creates it
  (or taps "Buat contoh perusahaan"). `autorun` is **off** by default: no agent spends tokens
  until the user turns on "Jalan otomatis" or presses "Bangunkan" on one agent.
- **Single source of truth = core.** Desktop and phone are views/controllers over the same RPCs.
- **Isolated files.** Everything lives in `~/.neovarch/company.db` (SQLite, WAL). Never `~/.hermes`.
- **Minimal hooks into existing code** (server.py / tools.py / agent.py / office.py get a few lines each),
  so rebases on the fast-moving `fix-core-parity` stay cheap.

## 2. Data model (`core/neovarch/company.py`, SQLite)
| table | key fields |
|---|---|
| `company` (1 row) | name, mission (top goal text), autorun, max_parallel (2), require_hire_approval, require_review, budget_monthly_cents, budget_monthly_tokens, warn_pct (80), price_in/out_per_mtok (cents), ticket_prefix (`NV`), ticket_counter |
| `goals` | id, parent_id (tree under the company mission), title, description, status |
| `projects` | id, goal_id, name, description, status, budget_monthly_cents |
| `agents` | id, name, title, role, reports_to (strict tree, no cycles), job_description, model, status, pause_reason, heartbeat_s (0 = only on events), budget_monthly_cents/tokens, session_id (persona chat), last_heartbeat_at |
| `tickets` | id, key `NV-12`, project_id, goal_id, parent_id, title, description, status, priority (0–3), assignee_id, **checkout_agent_id, checkout_run_id, checkout_at**, created_by, started_at, completed_at |
| `ticket_blockers` | ticket_id, blocker_id |
| `comments` | ticket_id, author_type (user/agent/system), author_id, body |
| `work_products` | ticket_id, kind (file/link/text), title, ref |
| `approvals` | kind (hire/plan/review/budget), status, ticket_id, agent_id, payload, note, decided_at |
| `runs` | heartbeat runs: agent_id, ticket_id, reason (assignment/comment/schedule/manual/routine/approval), status, session_id, error, tokens, cost_cents |
| `cost_events` | agent_id, project_id, ticket_id, run_id, prompt/completion tokens, cost_cents, month `YYYY-MM` |
| `wakeups` | queued wake requests (agent_id, reason, ticket_id) — coalesced per agent |
| `routines` | name, schedule (same parser as Jadwal/cron.py), agent_id, project_id, title, description, enabled, next_run_at |
| `activity` | ts, actor_type/actor_id, action (`ticket.moved`…), entity, summary (Indonesian), data |

Goal ancestry for a ticket = ticket → parent tickets → project → project goal → parent goals → company mission.
It is rendered into every heartbeat prompt and the persona, so each agent knows the "why".

## 3. State machines
**Ticket**: `backlog→todo|cancelled`; `todo→in_progress(checkout only)|blocked|backlog|cancelled`;
`in_progress→review|blocked|done|todo(release)|cancelled`; `review→in_progress|done|cancelled`;
`blocked→todo|in_progress|cancelled`; `done/cancelled` terminal except user "Buka lagi" → `todo`.
`done` by an agent when `require_review` → status `review` + a `review` approval; approve → `done`, reject → `in_progress` + comment.
A ticket with unresolved blockers cannot be checked out.

**Checkout lock** (atomic, one SQL statement under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`):
`UPDATE tickets SET status='in_progress', assignee_id=:a, checkout_agent_id=:a, checkout_run_id=:r … WHERE id=:t
AND status IN ('todo','backlog','blocked','review','in_progress') AND (assignee_id IS NULL OR assignee_id=:a)
AND (checkout_run_id IS NULL OR checkout_agent_id=:a)` → 0 rows ⇒ `409 conflict` with current owner.
The lock is per run: released when the run ends (status kept), or by `ticket.release` / user force-release.

**Agent**: `pending_approval→idle` (hire approved) · `idle↔running` · `running→error→idle` · `*→paused→idle`
(resume) · `*→terminated` (irreversible). Stop = interrupt the live run + release its lock + pause.

**Approval**: `pending→approved|rejected|cancelled`.

## 4. Heartbeats & delegation
`CompanyScheduler` (asyncio, tick `NEOVARCH_COMPANY_TICK`, default 10 s) — runs only when `autorun` is on,
except manual wakes which always run.
- Wake sources: ticket assigned/moved to todo (assignment), user comment on an agent's ticket (comment),
  approval decided (approval), `heartbeat_s` elapsed (schedule), routine due (routine → creates a ticket), "Bangunkan" (manual).
- One run per agent at a time; at most `max_parallel` runs overall. Skips paused/terminated/over-budget agents.
- Run = pick ticket (own `in_progress` first, then highest-priority unblocked `todo`) → checkout → submit a turn in the
  agent's own session (`source: "company"`) with the heartbeat prompt (persona + ancestry + ticket + last comments) →
  record usage as a cost event → release lock. Final text becomes a ticket comment if the agent didn't comment itself.
- Agent tools (only inside company sessions): `company_my_work`, `company_ticket_update` (status + comment),
  `company_comment`, `company_delegate` (create sub-ticket for a **report** in its subtree → wakes them),
  `company_escalate` (blocked + reassign to manager), `company_request_approval` (plan), `company_work_product`.

## 5. Governance, budgets, activity
- Approvals: hire (when `require_hire_approval`), plan (agent request), review (task completion), budget override.
- Budgets: monthly UTC window; per agent, per project, company; cents (from token prices) and/or tokens.
  ≥ `warn_pct` → activity `budget.warning` (once per month/scope); ≥ 100 % → agent auto-paused (`pause_reason=budget`),
  activity `budget.hard_stop`, no further runs until resumed / budget raised.
- Activity log: every mutation writes one row (actor, action, entity, Indonesian summary).

## 6. API (all also REST: `GET /api/company`, `POST /api/company/{method}`; JSON-RPC over `/api/ws`)
`company.snapshot` · `company.setup` · `company.update` · `company.seed_demo` · `company.goal.save|delete` ·
`company.project.save|delete` · `company.agent.save|pause|resume|stop|terminate|wake|runs` ·
`company.ticket.list|get|save|move|assign|checkout|release|comment|block|unblock|work_product` ·
`company.approval.list|decide` · `company.costs` · `company.activity` · `company.routine.save|delete|trigger`.
Errors: JSON-RPC `-32602` invalid, `-32004` not found, `-32009` conflict (checkout/transition) — REST 400/404/409.
Event: `company.changed` `{entity, id, action}` (coalesced) and `office.update` is re-pushed.

## 7. Mapping onto existing Kantor
- `Office.snapshot()` adds company agents as desks `kind:"company"`, id `company:<id>`, name/title as role,
  `status`: running→`working`, has pending approval/ticket in review→`waiting-approval`, else `idle`;
  extra `company: {agent_id, title, ticket_key, ticket_title, ticket_status, paused, reports_to}`. The 3D view keeps
  working unchanged and shows the ticket status badge from `company.ticket_status`.
- `office_status` tool summary gets a "Perusahaan" section (goal, agents, tickets by status, pending approvals, spend).
- Persona: a session with `company_agent_id` gets a persona block (name, title, manager, job, current ticket, ancestry,
  last activity) and the company tools; "lagi apa kamu" is answered in character from real data.

## 8. UI
- **Desktop** Kantor tabs: `Ruang` (existing 3D/list) · `Organisasi` · `Tiket` (kanban) · `Tujuan` · `Rutinitas` ·
  `Persetujuan` · `Biaya` · `Aktivitas`. Hidden behind an empty state ("Buat perusahaan") until a company exists;
  "Jalan otomatis" (autorun) stays off until the user turns it on.
  - Organisasi: each agent has "Ubah" → profile, manager (own reports excluded), heartbeat, monthly budget
    (cents/tokens), model (from `model.options`, empty = PC default; stored as `model`+`provider` on the agent and
    applied to its persona session at once), "Berhentikan" (terminate, two-click confirm).
  - Tiket detail: blockers list with "Lepas" and "Tambah hambatan" (open tickets only; cycles rejected by core).
  - Tujuan: mission editor, goal tree (create/edit/status/delete), projects with goal + monthly budget.
  - Rutinitas: list/create/edit/enable/delete, "Jalankan sekarang" (creates the ticket now).
  - The Kantor desk model popover on a company desk (`PUT /api/agents/company:<id>/model`) changes that agent only.
- **Android remote**: "Perusahaan" screen with tabs Organisasi / Tiket / Persetujuan / Biaya; approve/reject, pause/resume,
  wake, assign, move — all through the same RPCs over the paired gateway.
